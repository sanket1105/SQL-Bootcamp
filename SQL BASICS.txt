Databases: Collection of related information which can be stored in different ways which you liked.

DBMS: helps in managing, storing, backing up the data.
      Even helps in importing and exporting the data


4 most basic operations that DBMS must perform for us: 
C.R.U.D : Create Read Update Delete


Two types of Databases: Relational (SQL) and Non-Relational(NoSQL)

Relational Datasets are more like an Excel Spreadhseet

SQL: Organizes data into one or more tables
    Each table has rows and cols
    A unique key identifies each row

noSQL: Organize data in anything but a traditional table  
        Like: key-value stores, JSON or XML type documents, Graphs, Flexible Tables etc



#======================================================

some relational Databases (SQL):
mySQL,Oracle,postgreSQL,mariaDB

SQL is used to interact with RDBMS

-> SQL code on one RDBMS is not always portable on another RDBMS without modification

#======================================================

Some non-relational Databases (noSQL):
mongoDB,dynamoDB, apache, firebase etc

most of them will implement their own langauge for performing C.R.U.Databases

#======================================================

Database Queries:
Queries are requests made to the database management system for the specific info.
-> Google search is a query

#======================================================

Primary key: unique number or key used to define each row

Surrogate key: a primary key that has no mapping to the real world
                EX: employee number

Natural Key: a primary key that has mapping to the real world
                EX: social security number

Foreign Key: an attribute that we can store on the database that will link us to another database table 
              It basically stores the primary key of another database table 

              Ex: employee and branch id are 2 different databases. So linking the brach databasee to employee database.
              the brach column in the employee database will be the foreign key  

Composite keys: A composite key in SQL can be defined as a combination of multiple columns, 
                and these columns are used to identify all the rows that are involved uniquely
                 

#======================================================

SQL is used to interact with the RDBMS.
Certain SQL instructions might work on one RDBMs but not on another.
#======================================================

SQL a hybrid langauge:
-> DQL : Data Query Language -> Get info that is already stored there
-> DDL : Data Defination Language -> Used for defining database schemas -> What rows cols will be there in the database
-> DCL : Data Control Language -> Used for controlling access to data
-> DML : Data Manipulation Language -> Used for inserting, updating the data

#======================================================

Query: set of instructions gievn to the RDBMS so as to get what info you want to retrieve

#======================================================

Most common used datatypes in mysql:

-> INT : Whole numbers
-> DECIMAL(M,N) : Decimal number exact values
                : M will be total number of digits in number,  
                : N will be number of digits after decimal point   
                 
-> VARCHAR(l) : String of text of length l
-> BLOB : binary large object : Stoes large data
-> DATE : "yyyy-mm-dd"
-> TIMESTAMP : "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
